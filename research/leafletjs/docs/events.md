Leaflet exposes its own events, different from React. You can listen to them
using React-Leaflet by adding a callback to a property prefixed by `on`. Ex:
`<Map onMoveend={this.handleMoveend}>...</Map>`.\
Check [🍃 Leaflet's documentation](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.0.html) for the events associated to each component.
