⚠️ If you have not read the [introduction](intro.md) and [Leaflet setup](setup.md) parts before accessing this page, please **read them first**. The Leaflet setup is **required** to make the following instructions work.

## Using npm or Yarn

```bash
npm install react-leaflet # npm
yarn add react-leaflet # Yarn
```

React, ReactDOM, PropTypes and Leaflet are peer dependencies, if you haven't
already installed them you can use:

```bash
npm install leaflet prop-types react react-dom react-leaflet # npm
yarn add leaflet prop-types react react-dom react-leaflet # Yarn
```

You can then use the API as presented in the [example CodePen](https://codepen.io/PaulLeCam/pen/XVPmmj).

## UMD

UMD builds are available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) and
[CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react-leaflet) (replace `1.8.0` by the
version you need):

```html
<!-- unpkg, production (minified) -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-leaflet/dist/react-leaflet.min.js"></script>
<!-- unpkg, development -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-leaflet/dist/react-leaflet.js"></script>
<!-- CDNJS, production (minified) -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-leaflet/1.8.0/react-leaflet.min.js"></script>
<!-- CDNJS, development -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-leaflet/1.8.0/react-leaflet.js"></script>
```

The library is injected as `window.ReactLeaflet`.\
See the [UMD example](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/blob/master/example/umd.html) to get started.
